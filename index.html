                Hi, I’m Cris, a game designer and programmer who loves bringing ideas to life. I’ve got solid experience with C and C++ and enjoy diving into the technical side of things, from building gameplay systems to creating custom tools. I also have a knack for designing fun and engaging mechanics that make games stand out. Whether it’s working with Unreal Engine, Unity, or experimenting with new concepts, I’m always up for a challenge. My portfolio is a mix of games, prototypes, and cool projects that show what I can do.
